Plots of a^2H showing the spikes for several choices of the conformal
coupling $zeta = 0.5,1,2$.  
Full potential (modulo a sign I need to check on conformal coupling) was
lambda\phi^2/4 + g^2\phi^2\chi^2/2 + \zeta\phi^2 R, with g^2/lambda=1.875
and the correct noncanonical kinetic terms were used in the evolution.

The phi field was started from a rough analytic approximation to the end of
slow-roll, rather than a full numerical determination.  Shouldn't
qualitatively change anything.  x-axis is the same as Andrei's,
log(chi_0/phi_0)/\mu_0 T, with m_0T taken to be those in the lambda phi^4
model with no conformal coupling.
