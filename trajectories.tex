\section{Connecting Constrained Potentials in the Observable Range to the Potential in the Heating Regime }

B-modes help to really nail down the form of the potential during the
inflationary phase.  
Unfortunately, without a precise model to consider, the inflationary
dynamics are effectively independent of the reheating dynamics.
In particular, the inflaton condensate can break up via a variety of
different mechanisms depending on the ``shape'' of the potential
(tachyonic/spinodal instability, perturbative decay, amplification of
additional fields via parametric resonance followed by rescattering,...). 
The question is then how to relate the inflationary potential to the
potential at the minimum that is relevant for (p)reheating.
This seems rather difficult in the general case, since the ``shape'' of the
potential could change rather dramatically between inflation and
post-inflationary oscillations.  As some examples, in the single field case
the potential could be flattened (or steepened) at large field values, or
there could be a waterfall transition to end inflation.  This allows for a
large hierarchy between the effective mass of the inflaton during inflation
and the effective mass of the field as it oscillates.  Therefore, in the
completely general case it seems unlikely that the inflationary dynamics
could tell us much about the preheating dynamics.

Roughly, we want to have $P(\{a_i\},\{b_i\}|r)$ (or perhaps
$P(\{a_i\}|\{b_i\},r)$ for the case that the inflationary part is well
constrained)
where the $a_i$'s are some parameters that characterize the minimum of the
potential, and the $b_i$'s characterize the inflationary part of the
potential.
One possible approach is simply to expand the potential in a Taylor series
around the minimum (including several fields not just the inflaton).
It might also be interesting to expand in some other set of basis functions
(Chebychev's, Rational Chebyshev's, etc.).
This would at least give a definite way to define the coefficients in the
expansion.

One very unsophisticated take on this would be that a large value of $r$
means we have some sort of large-field model of inflation (even $m^2\phi^2$
for example).
If something like a simple polynomial is a good fit to the data during
inflation, then it is not unreasonable to consider the implications of
simply using a Taylor expansion around the minimum of the potential for the
preheating as well as the inflationary dynamics.
Naively, I would say this puts us into preheating regime that is described
by the billiard picture (although this might not be true).
Since we have a large field model, the effective couplings of the inflaton
to other fields will be enhanced by $(\phi_{end}/m_{eff})^{power} \sim
(M_P/m_{eff})^{power}$ and the couplings in the model will have to be very
small to be in the perturbative regime.
If this is true, then preheating and the eventual development of
nonlinearly interacting inhomogeneous fields is the correct description of
the end of inflation (modelling with some simple decay models isn't), which
is of course exactly what we've been working on.

The cleanest way to connect the B-mode results to preheating would be to
just assume that the Higgs is the inflaton (assuming that some appropriate
non-minimal terms in the Lagrangian or quantum effects allow it to match
the data).
Then we at least know all of the interactions as the Higgs is oscillating
around its minimum (and there are couplings to the gauge bosons of the form
$g^2h^2Z^2$ so it is not that dissimilar from $\lambda\phi^4 +
g^2\phi^2\chi^2$ billiards.
There are a couple papers on Higgs preheating (0812.4624 and 0812.3622),
but no lattice/nonlinear analysis that I know of.
Of course, having isocurvature modes in the gauge fields is probably
severely constrained so this might not be that interesting, and dealing
with the fermions is nontrivial.


\section{Flattening Preheating Potentials via Conformal Transformations}

\begin{equation} V(\phi, \chi) = 1/4 \lambda \phi^4  - 1/2 \xi \phi^2 R  1/2 g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2 \, .
\end{equation}

Conformal V-flattening as in SBB89, explored there as Higgs inflation with variable Planck mass models. 

The kinetic piece transforms as 

The field going into canonical form is 

The potential is transformed  as 

SBB considered large $\xi$. 

This story was recently picked up by Kallosh and Linde, who considered $\xi = 1/6 -\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is small. 

This should be compared with the heavy field V-flattening described in Dong, Horn, Silverstein, Westphal 2011, with $\phi^{2n}, \ n<1$ 
via heavy field trough driving light inflaton $V_{eff}$ yielding 
$r = 8n/(N_I +n/3) 1-ns  = (n+1)/(N_I-n/6)$, as in bh95. These forms are P13 OK

An example is one of the first  monodromy cases considered, SW08, with $p=1/3$. Later the form adopted in  MSW08 had $p=1/2$ and a $ \cos $ term associated with a shift symmetry. Another example is  roulette inflation (Kahler moduli) BKKV, where V-flat appears naturally.
